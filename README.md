# Bio-Inspired Computing Project

## Overview

This repository contains implementations of bio-inspired algorithms for solving combinatorial optimization problems, specifically focusing on the Knapsack Problem and the Cutting Stock Problem. The algorithms are based on Genetic Algorithms, a nature-inspired optimization technique.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **`knapsack_problem/`**: Implementation of Genetic Algorithm for solving the Knapsack Problem.
  - `implementacaoKnapsack.py`: Python script containing the genetic algorithm for the Knapsack Problem.

  - `utils.py`: Utility functions used by both problem implementations.

  - `analiseKnapsack.ipynb`: Python script containing the genetic algorithm for the Knapsack Problem.

## Dependencies

The implementations use Python and require the following libraries:


- `random`: Python built-in library for generating random numbers.
- `os`: Python built-in library for interacting with the operating system.
- `pandas`:
- `matplotlib.pyplot`:
